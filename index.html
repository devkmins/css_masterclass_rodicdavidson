            <span>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</span>
            <p>
              Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
              since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we
              have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
              Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
              experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
              Consents and Great Estate Licenses.<br /><br />Many areas within
              central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic
              families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden, Portman
              and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes of,
              what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These
              Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct
              ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an example being
              the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor.
              Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the
              use, development, and appearance of the designated area.<br /><br />We
              have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
              elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
              iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
              established a track record of obtaining difficult planning
              consents for both new-build and existing properties.

            <p>
              We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
              interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than
              brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our
              environment. Our practice specializes in design-led and highly
              crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an
              ability to deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst
              safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.<br /><br />We are
              a RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central London.
              Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the practice has
              an expanding portfolio of work across the UK; predominantly in the
              east and southeast of England but also including projects reaching
              as far as Scotland. We have experience working in rural locations,
              particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Sussex where we have
              undertaken a number of farmstead and country house projects, for
              both UK and overseas-based clients. These projects often involve
              sensitive restoration of listed buildings, usually with some more
              contemporary new-build additions. The practice seeks to develop
              sensitive yet ambitious design solutions that celebrate heritage
              while recognizing that buildings are often now required to perform
              different functions and should consume less carbon in doing so. In
              striving for lower carbon design solutions, we look to insulate
              well and integrate renewable technologies wherever possible.
